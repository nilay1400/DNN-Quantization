# FORTUNE: A Negative Memory Overhead Hardware-Agnostic Fault TOleRance TechniqUe in DNNs

Link to the paper: .....................

This is the official repository for the implementation of FORTUNE: A Negative Memory Overhead Hardware-Agnostic Fault TOleRance TechniqUe in DNNs. This paper presents a hardware-agnostic fault tolerance technique for DNNs that leverages quantization to enhance reliability without significant performance overhead.

## Features
- Negative overhead fault tolerance technique
- Design space exploration framework
- Introduction of two new metrics for evaluating reliability
- Validation
